# Exploratory Data Analysis Project 1

This project is focused on generating plots from the data set [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/)

This repository contains the following files:

- `README.md`, this file, which provides an overview of the data set and how it was created.
- plot1.png
- plot1.R
- plot2.png
- plot2.R
- plot3.png
- plot3.R
- plot4.png
- plot4.R

The source data set that this project was based on was obtained from the [Electric Power Consumption](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip).


The R scripts plot1.R, plot2.R, plot3.R, plot4.R are used to create the plot PNG files that are also in the repo. 


This script requires the `ggplot2` package (v0.5.0 was used).
